# MY KATRINA STORY

This is an email I wrote to my family as soon as power was restored to my house in Mississippi, 5 days after Hurricane Katrina changed life there forever. It is unedited and was written in one sitting, as I feared the power would fail before I could get notice out.

The worst is over… I hope.  We have survived and the power is back on at our house.  We are VERY lucky.  I’ve not been able to reach Dad since Monday, has anyone heard from him?  Clean-up is going to be a MAJOR undertaking for the entire region, and me personally.  I have a big tree down in my back yard, and no way to get at it from the pie-shape that is my back yard.  I had a whole roll of fine Berber carpet (100% wool) in the carport, ready to replace the raggedy mess that is my living room.  The Berber is now several tons of soggy mass that I must figure out what to do with.  Anyone want some rather damp carpet?

Hurricane Katrina made landfall at 6:10AM on August 29, 2005, near Buras Louisianna.  It made a second landfall in SW Mississippi.  My power went out at 10:30AM, but the full fury of lady Katrina did not hit until 5PM.  By 7PM, 97% of electric customers in MS were without power.  My wife and I huddled in what we thought was the safest place in the house, completely ignorant as to what the hell was going on, from 10:30AM until the storm finally abated somewhere close to midnight.  The sound of broken trees crashing a constant reminder of our fragile life.  Time seems to go very slow in times of extreme panic, and every minute seems an eternity.   It was by far the longest day of my life, and I was completely exhausted when it was over.

This hurricane pointed out several things to me that I had never spent any time thinking about, besides just the obvious point of our tenuous grip to this earthly existence.  We have as a society become complacent and overconfident in our technology, and take far too many things for granted.  With all of our fancy toys and electronic wizardry, something like a Cat 5 storm can STILL sneak up on us!  Most of us forget that just 2 days before landfall, it could have hit anywhere from the Florida coast to Texas.  Many thought it would do what most hurricanes do when approaching the warm shallow water of the Louisiana coastal plain… peter down to a Cat 2 and be a pain in the neck, but not a big deal.  MS was worried for their neighbors to the west, but not overly concerned about themselves.  No one foresaw what would happen to Mississippi, nor did they have much of a clue what would happen to a major city like New Orleans.  By the time it sunk in to me that I was unprepared (when my power went out at 10:30AM) the stores were already nearly empty.  I did manage to find a coleman lantern which proved to be a life-saver, some food that would keep on ice, and some charcoal so we could cook.  Even at this early point, there was not a battery to be found in the city of Jackson, capital of MS.  The smartest thing I did was to fill both cars with gas.  On the first day post-storm, I went to start up the charcoal grill and cook dinner, only to discover a previously unknown hole in the storage room ceiling… the bag had gotten soaked and disintegrated when I picked it up, spilling precious charcoal all over the wet carport… now there was no charcoal to be found anywhere, or any ice for the food we couldn’t cook.  We have been very hungry.

This storm was a sneaky bastard.  Not only did it manage to hide its’ full fury until making landfall, it was unique in a very fatal aspect… Hurricanes are not uncommon to the Gulf coast… everyone knows stories of the monster Camille back in 1969, which hit squarely on the MS coast with winds in excess of 200MPH.  But Camille did not push a wall of water nearly 30 feet tall.  Katrina did, obliterating all sign of man for nearly half a mile inland.  The swath of destruction runs nearly the entire length of the MS coast, and entire cities just no longer exist, wiped clean from the face of the earth.  My wife and I enjoyed going to the coast and driving along US Highway 90 that runs parallel to the beach, with antebellum mansions on the inland side of the road.  Mansions like Beauvoir, last home of Jefferson Davis built in 1852.  Camille and its’ 200MPH wind only took a few shingles off the roof.  Katrina gutted Beauvoir and left it a hulking ruin… but most of the mansions along Highway 90 were taken down to the slab, not a shred of the house left standing.  Highway 90 is even gone.  The beautiful live oaks, hundreds of years old, ripped up like so many spoiled carrots.  A lot of goods are shipped into the ports down there, and a good deal of the cargo turned into deadly missiles.  Great rolls of paper weighing 2 tons each (only 3 of these will fit in an 18-wheeler trailer) became wrecking balls, obliterating neighborhoods in their path.  Forrest County MS had their entire sewage system vanish.  There were a lot of big casinos on the coast, but MS law demanded that they be built on barges actually ON the water.  The coast is now scattered with slot machines, the casinos great piles of debris far inland.  Hattiesburg is a fairly large city 75 miles from the coast, home to Southern Mississippi University, Alma Mater to one Brett Favre of NFL football fame.  Hattiesburg was pounded unmercifully, and have had to close their hospital due to lack of water or power.  Power is said to be weeks away.  If you have seen old newspapers from this area back in the early 1900’s when yellow fever wiped out much of the population, you will find them to be page after page of lists of the dead. The first newspaper to be printed on the coast came out today.  How they managed this I have no clue, but it was similar in content to the early 1900’s version.  Todays’ lists were not just of the dead, but pleas from families looking for the missing.  People looking for hope that is most likely not to come.  Please pray for these souls, who have already suffered too much…

I have spent the last 4 days living as I expect I would after Armageddon roars.  The fabric of society has been rent asunder, and we are left pretty much to our own devices as we can.  Almost no stores are open, and the ones that are open have nothing useful in them.  No food, no gas, no ice, no batteries, no water.  The city water in contaminated and unsafe to drink without boiling, but most folks cannot boil anything.  We all still go to the stores that are open, hoping that some supplies have come in, but none have yet arrived.  Trees are still falling, and sometimes a fruitless search for supplies ends up a search for a way to get home as streets that were open an hour ago are now blocked by downed trees.  Some stores are even open without power, and use a shoebox instead of a cash register which will not work if the power is out.  Most of the rescue effort is headed to the coast, as they do not even have houses to huddle in.  Most of that effort is directed towards hacking thru the debris to reach stranded communities.  A lot of people are desperately trying to reach loved ones, and you see posters pleading for information plastered everywhere.  Our only life-line to the outside world was Miss 103FM, one of the few radio stations to not have their tower come down.  There is no TV.  Miss 103FM is on the air begging for people to bring them fuel to keep their generators going, or they will go dark, too.  There is no fuel.  I have few batteries, so I only check the news periodically, and news is the only thing being broadcast… news of storm damage and history lost, information on where aid can be found, places that have re-opened, bits and pieces of the history of this thing not yet written.  To save batteries for the house, I often listen to the car radio.  I took notes, just for something to do.

Jackson MS is 150 miles from the coast, but was hit by a Cat 3 hurricane still holding its’ rare double-walled eye 30 miles wide, and a circular band pattern.  Most of the wind gages were destroyed by the storm, and debate rages as to true wind speeds at various places.  It was still close to 100MPH when it went over my house, I don’t care what anyone says differently.  

First thing, trees.  A 50-foot Hackberry tree fell in the back yard while the eye of the storm was still near the coast, missing my bedroom wall by less than a foot.  Hackberry trees are hard-woods noted for their sturdiness and ability to withstand high winds.  There are 2 wobbly and very tall pine trees in the front yard.  One of these pine trees has a broken limb that has hung by a thread since I moved into the house, directly over the mailbox like the sword of Damocles.  I have been waiting for this limb to fall off for 20 years.  Neither of these pine trees or the broken limb seemed any worse for wear after the storm was over.  You figure it out.  A chinaberry tree whipped around by the wind to the point it removed a good bit of paint from the front of the house, but didn’t lose many limbs.  The remaining limbs do not appear to be broken, but sag lifelessly over the power lines… will have to do something about that if they don’t perk up and get off the lines.  Trees are an important part of the story of Katrina because Mississippi is a state with heavy tree cover (lots of commercially grown trees for paper companies) and a hell of a lot of them are no longer standing.    The most common horror story you hear is the tale of families huddled for endless hours as the storm raged with the sound of crashing trees filling the air.  A lot of casualties came from falling trees, and they are the reason most of the state is dark, and will be dark for a long time.  Entire communities are cut off from the world from downed trees.  Trees like to fall on power lines, and often you will see a power pole broken off below the transformer… the top of the pole with the power lines and transformer still attached, laying in the most unlikely places.  The lines were apparently stronger than the poles.  Very dangerous.  Even though a lot of trees came down everywhere, I am amazed at how few actually fell on a house.  I had always assumed the pine trees would go down first, but most of them are still up and it was the hardwoods that fell.  Apparently the flexibility of pines are their saving grace.  

One of the best tree stories to come out of the storm was this one.  Waveland MS was a quiet oceanside community with a new police chief, and he noticed an unsightly and beggarly looking shrub near the station that blocked his office view of the ocean out front.  He ordered the ugly shrub cut down, but no one ever got around to cutting it down.  Waveland no longer exists, and 8 police officers are alive today because they clung to the branches of this ugly shrub as a 29-foot wall of water tried to sweep them to their doom.  The shrub is now both a hero and a shrine, many colored ribbons hanging from its’ now beautiful branches, and a lot of officers now take credit for not cutting it down.  Waveland is building a new police station, and the ugly shrub will have a place of honor, with a plaque.

There are some strange things to report, things that don’t seem to make much sense.  The convenience store that I stop at every day for coffee NEVER lost power.  It sits perfectly pristine and glowing beacon in the darkness.  Right next door, on the same side of the street, one entire wall of a Chinese restaurant collapsed in a great pile of bricks.  You can walk right in and sit at one of the tables still there and ask about the legend of my daughter flicking a piece of rice right up my favorite nostril, but no one will answer you and no food will be coming.  

One of the stranger post-storm aspects is the lack of bugs.  I tried to sleep in the car last night, as it is cooler outside than in the house.  I expected to be eaten alive by mosquitos, but there were none!  I guess they are all somewhere in Nebraska now, carried by the wind.  But even though the mosquitos were gone and it cooler outside than in the house, I finally gave up on trying to sleep and went back in the house.  Why?           
Because people are a lot of work.  I live on a residential street that goes nowhere except to other residential streets and is by no means well-traveled on an average day… but at 1AM as I try to achieve sleep, traffic was CONSTANT, and LOUD.  Mind you, there are no stores open, gas stations have no gas, there is nothing to do and nowhere to go, lots of roads still closed to traffic, and there is an alleged police-enforced-curfew from 8PM-8AM… but the streets are full.  Why?
Because people are a lot of work.  They want air conditioning, which is only available in a running car, even if they know the tank of gas they are wasting is the only gas they will have for some time.  The cars, mostly filled with young black hooligans, (Jackson is 80% black) prowl the neighborhoods with rap music blasting, rattling the fenders of the cars… nearly running over the endless conga line mob out walking the streets (presumably after they ran out of gas) making even more noise than the cars, if that is possible.  I see one young man whooping it up on a bicycle, a flashlight strapped to the handlebars.  Shortly after this, a black woman comes to my car and asks me which way the young man went with the flashlight.  She is not so much worried about his safety as she is pissed that he is out romping around with the only batteries in the house.  
By this time, I am having great doubts as to the ability of this society to survive before sinking into raw jungle mentality if it goes on much longer, and can only wonder what would happen in a place like New York City.  I have no good advice for the angry lady, and go back into the house to roast.

I’ll pass along another strange story, not knowing yet if it is true or not.  There was a tourist trap souvenir shop on the coast, I’ve been in it a few times… there was nothing remarkable about the shop or its’ contents.   Its’ claim to fame was that there was a shrimp boat on the property, left there from hurricane Camille back in ’69.  There is not a shred of evidence that man has ever been anywhere near this place from the beginning of time… but the shrimp boat is still there.

People are a lot of work.  The same people out WASTING gasoline by aimlessly driving around just for the air conditioning, are the first ones to create a ruckus at the gas station when there is no gas to be had at any price.  Over 200 of the 350 traffic lights in Jackson are out, there is nothing open, nothing to do, and gas supplies non-existent… so the police advise everyone to stay off the roads so utility trucks can move without traffic hindrance.  This does not happen. When you get to a busy intersection with no traffic light working, you are supposed to treat it like a 4-way stop and take turns proceeding with caution.  This does not happen.  Cars blow through the intersection at 50MPH, music blaring and they going nowhere fast.  The only light working on a main through-way is is a blinking yellow light, telling you to slow down to 25MPH for a nearby school… it is only supposed to blink for a few hours a day when school is letting out or starting up… the light blinks at 1AM, and school weeks away from opening up.  

People are a lot of work, but there are rays of hope out there.  The fabric of humanity has been stretched to the brink, but it has held.  All is not lost as much as it might seem.  Jackson MS has seen more than its’ share of racial strife over the years, and the wounds are still open and raw to many residents.  But in these last 4 days, we do not notice much what skin color anyone might have.  I hope that this might become a lasting thing, hope springs eternal to the optimist.  Neighbors who were previously complete strangers are now a lot closer.  We watch other houses for looters.  Those with chain saws are out getting trees off the road, roads they do not use or live on.  We congregate at stores and swap tales of where needful things might be found and rumors of coming supplies.  We help each other when help needed and not asked for, mindless of color or social standing.  In fact, at times such as this, none of us HAVE any more status than another.  

There is not much of a way to help others find gasoline… if you are not in line when the gas tanker truck arrives, you do not get any… 4,000 gallons of gas in the tanker will disappear in less than 2 hours, and there are always more than 2 hours worth of cars in line waiting for it.  These lines stretch out along the side of the road for a considerable distance from the station, not moving at all for a long time as the line behind them grows.  When a tanker comes to re-fill the gas station, most of the line moves by hand… people pushing cars up to the pump.  The police do not bother the people camped out in cars waiting for gas, even though the cars are actually IN THE STREET, normally a ticket just waiting to happen.  But if they even THINK you are trying to jump the line, they will draw weapons and threaten you with deadly force.  I went to a convenience store just to get something inside the store… the cops thought I was trying to jump the line, and I had to do LOTS of ‘splainin’ just to park in the spots in front of the store, nowhere near the gas pumps…. I seriously thought they were going to shoot me…  

It is hard to imagine, but there are utility trucks here from as far away as Iowa, and it is quite common to see a line of these trucks on the road as far as the eye can see, usually headed south.  People emerge from houses and offer the crews anything they might have, as thanks for them coming to help us.  One was parked out in front of my house yesterday, and I went out to see if they needed anything… 
“Would you like some damp charcoal?” He had a bottle of water on the lift bucket already, so I guessed he didn’t need any… and we were hurting for water ourselves.
“No, we don’t need anything.  We are more worried about YOU.”
I would have kissed the guy, but he was out of reach and probably would have clouted me for trying such a thing.

One day we ventured out in fruitless search for supplies, joining the circular vagabonds who go places they have already been several times before and always came away empty-handed.  I got in line at a convenience store, keeping my ear open as to conversation going on between the harried cashier and the frustrated customers.  A man at the front of the front of the line became cross at news that there was still no hope for gas, food, water, ice, or batteries.  I found the bile in my own throat rising, also angry at the news.  
The man turned to his wife and loudly exclaimed,  “DAMN this place! Let’s go home!”
The wife meekly reminded the man that they had no home to go home to, it was gone with the wind.  I bowed my head in shame, and tears soon became to roll out of the factory, a production line that had been shut down since the start of this tragedy.  Once started, it was hard to stop, and there were several others in line equally shamed that they were angry, but had much to be thankful for.  Their family was safe, and they had a safe place to sleep that night.  We might not know where our next meal was coming from of what the future might hold, but we were much better off than the angry man at the counter and we had no reason to be angry with the store employees.  My head was still down, and the tears were still rolling down the production line, when I felt a hand on my shoulder.  It was an elderly black man behind me in line, and he was going through the same catharsis as I.  I will never forget that moment as long as I live.

This morning, just as I was beginning to despair at the news that temps would reach 96 degrees and no hope of air conditioning were on the horizon…A light drizzle began to fall, cooling things down.  The land-line phone rang.  Power was still out but the phones worked for some reason.  It was my boss… power was restored at the factory.  The factory that I dreaded going to every day because it was ever a blast furnace of heat, it was now an oasis paradise to me… I knew they had fans!  I went to work that day and came home to find the power was now on at the house and the A/C working.  I laid on the floor atop an air vent for a good hour before moving.

**Things to seriously consider:**

The things that you today hold near and dear, take for granted even, can all too quickly become fleeting memory never regained.  A lot of things you hold near and dear can be quickly exposed as flimsy items of no real importance.  One should take the time to prepare a survival kit for your family in time of need.  Panic will empty the store shelves in a matter of minutes.  It doesn’t take a hurricane for hunger to set in, other bad things can happen.  If you do not have a decent-sized generator for your house, you should get one and have lots of fuel on hand for it.  Building a bunker to survive a direct nuclear strike, complete with a command center and 642 canned hams may be taking it too far, but a pantry holding only 2 packs of ramen noodles, a pound of weed, and a bag of Fritos may be too optimistic a view of emergency supply.

Families are now commonly spread out all over the country, and do not clump together like families did in the past.  When dark days come, a wandering lifestyle may leave you far away from the needed support of family and friends.  No matter what has happened in the past, it will be nothing in times like this, and reconciliation with loved ones should not be put off as you may never get the chance again.

Times will come when money gets you nothing.  Fort Knox can not feed you when the grocery store is barren, and gold bars will not warm you on a cold winter night alone.

For those of you who consider man to be supreme master of all he surveys, consider the finger of God when it comes to rest upon the land.  It is easy to forget God in times of plenty and easy to blame Him in times of want, but there are no atheists to stare a hurricane in the eye.
